Website provides a search function to find all R&M characters, it will read back a description of them, where you can find them, and a photo. The main page provides a carousel type function that allows you to click through the characters from left and right buttons, there is also an input box allowing you to search specific characters by name.


Day 1: put together base functionality, create the carousel
Day 2: create the input box and link it to the carousel's functionality
Day 3: allow content to appear based off information gathered from carousel and search engine.
day 4+: format the page/add effects/clean it up.



In the future, add swipe functionality on mobile and do away with the buttons.

Load all images and use animations to traverse the page!

Add some custom animations (with credit). I found some amazing animations from creators out there in the web.

Figuring out border animations


incorporating an ajax call that can give live updates to the length of the carousel, if they add characters to the API then the page can have those without needing an update from my end.
.....

Fun things, calling an ajax within an ajax by using the first ajax's object notation.

Using shadowing to make the Rick and Morty logo by hand.

adding animations to the buttons!
